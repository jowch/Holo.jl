# Holo.jl — Roadmap

Where v0.1 is and how the rest of the feature set gets built. Grounded in the design:
`architecture.md` (the contract + tiers), `survey-makie-surfaces.md` (the v1/v2 surface
map), `frontend-delivery.md` (build/delivery). Priorities, not promises — reorder freely.

## Guiding principles (don't drift)
- **Explicit declaration is the contract; introspection is sugar** on top of it.
- **Frontend is a stateless view**; authoritative state lives in Julia via `@bind`.
- **No parallel server**; inspection survives offline/static-export, clicks need a kernel.
- **Fail loud, never silently wrong** (per-capability `validate`).
- **YAGNI**: build a surface/feature when a real use pulls for it, not preemptively.

## Status — v0.1 (done)
Backend seam (CairoBackend) · `AbstractInteractable` + `HitLayer` · 5 built-ins
(Point/Segment/Rect[list+grid]/Polygon/Axis) with explicit-geometry constructors · custom
paths (Region/Function) · TS overlay bundle + `published_to_js` + shadow DOM · typed
`InteractionEvent` · categorical/log/multi-axis · DPI policy · CI (Julia + frontend + Runic).
**Live-verified end-to-end for `PointInteractable`**; other kinds unit-tested only.

---

## M1 — Harden v1 (finish what exists) ✅ *done*
*Goal: every shipped feature is real and demonstrated. No new surfaces.*

- [x] **Live-verify the remaining kinds** in Pluto: Segment, Rect(list+grid/heatmap), Polygon, Axis-readout. (Machinery is proven for circles; this closes the per-kind gap.) *Done: `examples/demo.jl` exercises all five live; verified via headless Pluto + Playwright.*
- [x] **Selection round-trip → re-highlight.** Wire the designed loop: bond value → Julia marks selected indices on the manifest → overlay pre-highlights on mount (`HitLayer.selected` already exists in the TS). *Done: `selected` keyword on `holo`/`build_manifest`; clicked points re-highlight flicker-free (verified live).*
- [x] **`examples/` notebook** — self-contained Pluto notebook (`examples/demo.jl`) that devs the package via a checkout-relative `@__DIR__` path. *Done: opens and runs clean from a fresh checkout; a CI job runs it headlessly so it can't rot.* (Used Pluto's self-contained notebook env, not a sidecar `Project.toml`.)
- [x] **Docs**: expanded README API section (`holo`, each interactable, custom paths, payload-is-`Dict` contract, selection round-trip). Documenter site deferred to M5 (pre-registration → YAGNI).
- [x] **Robustness validation**: fail loud on out-of-scope configs (PolarAxis/Axis3/LScene) at `holo()` time — one `AbstractAxis`-not-`Axis` guard in `context()`.

## M2 — Ergonomics (the big unlock)
*Goal: stop hand-writing geometry. `survey-makie-surfaces.md` has the extraction recipes.*

- [x] **Plot-introspection constructors**: `PointInteractable(ax, scatter)`, `RectInteractable(ax, heatmap)`, `SegmentInteractable(ax, lines)`, etc. — pull geometry from live Makie plot objects via `plot.converted[]`. *Done (`src/introspect.jl`): Scatter/Lines/LineSegments/Heatmap/Image/BarPlot/Poly delegate to the explicit constructors with identical hitlayers (tested). Gotchas handled: markersize→radius (pixel space), heatmap `EndPoints`→edge expansion, bar dodge/stack/auto-width read from the laid-out child rects. `ax` is passed (a plot has no axis back-reference); single-arg sugar arrives with M2.2's scene walk.*
- [x] **`holo(fig)` auto-extraction**: walk the scene graph, emit a concrete `Vector{AbstractInteractable}` (the same one a user could write). Unknown plot type → skip + warn. Sugar over M2.1, not a separate path. *Done (`src/introspect.jl`): `auto_interactables(fig)` walks each `Axis`'s `scene.plots`, maps each supported plot via the M2.1 constructors, dedupes layer ids (`:scatter`, `:scatter_2`, …), and skips unsupported types with a warning. `holo(fig)` is the zero-config overlay; both exported.*
- [x] **Richer tooltips (M2.3)** — `holo"…"` template macro, auto name/value table default, and figure-level `tooltip_*` theming. *Done (PR #10): see Phase 1 / `docs/tooltips.md`.*

## M3 — Surface coverage (v2 from the survey)
*Goal: more plot types, same primitives. Add per real demand.*

- [x] **Cheap wins** (existing primitives): Stairs, Errorbars/Rangebars, HLines/VLines, Stem, Spy, ScatterLines (composite → two layers). *Done (`src/introspect.jl`): introspection constructors delegating to the M1 primitives — Stairs→`Segment(:polyline)` (reads the child Lines' expanded staircase, not the raw input pts), Errorbars/Rangebars→`Segment(:pairs)`, HLines/VLines→`Segment(:pairs)` spanning `finallimits`, Spy→`Rect(:list)` of unit cells off the `:data`-markerspace child Scatter, Stem/ScatterLines→two layers (Point+Segment) via their child plots. All wired into `holo(fig)`; unit-tested against the explicit constructors + rendered-geometry. Deferred: richer `{i,j,value}`/`value`/`equation` payloads (→ M2.3 tooltips), fractional HLines/VLines span attrs.*
- [x] **Filled-area curves (Band/Density)**: Band and Density auto-extracted by `holo(fig)` as `:polygons` with `(; index)` payload. *Done (`src/introspect.jl`).*
- [x] **Computational-geometry extraction**: Contourf/Violin/Voronoiplot + BoxPlot box-body shipped; Tricontourf deferred; BoxPlot box-body-only (whiskers/outliers decorative). *Done (`src/introspect.jl`): Contourf → `:polygons` per contour level with `(; low, high)` from Makie's computed level range; Violin → `:polygons` with `(; x)` from the data position; Voronoiplot → `:polygons` with `(; index)`; BoxPlot box-body → `:rects` (un-notched) / `:polygons` (notched) with `(; q1, median, q3)` from Makie's computed-stats node. Principle: hit geometry from rendered shapes; payload values from Makie's computed values.*
- [x] **Bars/areas** *(Hist/Waterfall/CrossBar/HSpan/VSpan done; Colorbar done M3; Legend remaining)*: Hist, Waterfall, CrossBar, HSpan, VSpan now auto-extracted by `holo(fig)` as `:rects` (same primitive as BarPlot, no new JS path). Shared bar payload schema — semantic, no redundant `index` (element index lives in `InteractionEvent.index`): BarPlot/Waterfall `(; low, high, value)`, Hist `(; value, low, high)`, CrossBar `(; midpoint, low, high)`, HSpan/VSpan `(; low, high)`. Span hit-rects clamped to the owning axis's pixel viewport (prevents cross-axis bleed in multi-axis figures). Uniform fail-loud payload-length validation (`_check_payloads`) added to `SegmentInteractable`/`RectInteractable`/`PolygonInteractable` — a wrong-length `payloads=` now throws `ArgumentError` at construction. *Colorbar: done (M3) — `ColorbarInteractable` auto-extracted from `fig.content`; figure-block walk now exists and Legend slots in the same place. Remaining: Legend (deferred — a linking capability, its own arc).*
- [x] **Text bboxes** (Text/Annotation): `TextInteractable` — `text!`/`annotation!` labels auto-extracted as `:rects` click-to-pick buttons, payload `(; text, index, x, y)`. *Done: the original "needs font-metric measurement → new `bbox` primitive" premise was obsolete — `Makie.string_boundingboxes` already returns per-string boxes, so no new geometry kind or dependency was needed. `TextLabel` (a `Block`, not a plot — needs the figure-block walk `ColorbarInteractable` uses, not the scene-plot walk) is the remaining deferred piece.*
- [ ] **SVG output path**: `CairoBackend(vector=true)` is groundwork; actually emit SVG base + overlay for sparse, low-primitive plots (cleaner coords, no raster).
- [x] **Axis3 overlays (parity) — core** *(delivered 2026-07-02, WS-3D core widening)*:
      Point/Segment/Polygon storage + the shared projection closure widened to 3D (`Point3f`,
      z=0 for 2-coord input — every pre-existing golden value-identical modulo the new `is3d`
      transform key, so the widen provably didn't move 2D); `:cairo` guard lifted (`Axis3`
      collected on both backends; `PolarAxis`/`LScene` still rejected pending their decision
      item below); `is3d` `AxisTransform` (degenerate lims — `Axis`/`Threshold`/`ROI`
      interactables fail loud: a screen pixel on a 3D axis is a ray, not a data point); z-aware
      `{index,x,y,z}` payloads; 3-coord `Scatter`/`Lines` introspection; `axis3` parity-corpus
      figure (goldens **byte-identical across backends**); an Axis3 case in the real-browser
      E2E (click + z payload through `transform_value`). Live-verified on both halves:
      `:cairo` through-Pluto (hover tooltip shows the z row; bond round-trips through a live
      kernel) and the `:webgl` **canvas-alignment spike — passed** (every build-time projected
      marker center sits on a GPU-rendered marker pixel; figure recorded in `perf-findings.md`
      §"Axis3 projection hinge spike"; re-runnable via `test/e2e/alignment.mjs`).
- [x] **Axis3 per-type extraction — MeshScatter + Wireframe** *(delivered 2026-07-02)*:
      `MeshScatter` → `PointInteractable` with **depth-correct per-element pixel radii** — its
      `markersize` is data-space by construction (no `markerspace` attribute at all, spike-verified),
      so `PointInteractable` gained an optional `radius3d` (data-space half-extents; hitlayers
      projects the ±axis offsets per element — the wire shape is unchanged, `:circles` always
      carried per-element r). `Wireframe` → `SegmentInteractable(:pairs)` from its child
      `LineSegments`' converted (data space, spike-verified; includes the triangulation diagonals
      a grid-edge reconstruction would miss). Both graduate out of the Axis3 introspection gate;
      rendered-pixel unit tests + through-Pluto live-verify.
- [ ] **Axis3 per-type extraction — Arrows3D** — **premise corrected (2026-07-02):** the planned
      "Segment/:pairs base→tip from data" is WRONG — `arrows3d` autoscales (resolved
      `arrowscale` ≈ 2.84 on the spike scene) and renders via three `MeshScatter` children whose
      positions/rotations/markersizes live in a **normalized, anisotropically-scaled space** (data
      (1,1,1) → child (−0.909,−0.909,−0.606)), so raw pos→pos+dir matches the drawn pixels for
      some arrows and misses others. A real recipe must reconstruct shaft+tip extents from the
      children (quaternion rotation × markersize.z along the shaft axis) or resolve the scaling
      chain — its own arc. Until then arrows3d skip-warns (no `_plotbase` entry).
      `Surface` stays deferred (unbounded per-cell payload + occlusion — same class as the heatmap
      `values[]` hole). Occlusion policy: **document-and-accept on both backends** (no
      `:webgl`-only GPU-pick); upgrade path = a build-time CPU painter's cull in Julia,
      backend-symmetric by construction.
- [ ] **View manipulation via `@bind` re-render (pan/zoom/rotate, parity)** — supersedes the
      2026-07-01 "investigated → deferred" framing, which scoped the problem as a *client-side*
      camera (the shim disables WGLMakie's `use_orbit_cam`; 2D zoom/pan is dead under
      `Bonito.NoConnection` — still true, still intentional). The re-frame: view params (2D
      `limits`, 3D `azimuth`/`elevation`) are ordinary `@bind` state — change → server re-render →
      fresh overlay — **backend-symmetric and drift-free by construction** (Julia recomputes the
      overlay every step). Sliders/controls first (`:cairo` needs nothing; `:webgl` is gated on
      GL-context **reuse** — persist canvas+renderer across cell re-runs, dispose-on-delete; the
      re-run-vs-delete lifecycle spike is the open feasibility question). Drag-to-pan/rotate is the
      follow-on (commit-on-release; a live drag *preview* shares the Animation/scrubbing item's
      payload gate — M4, below; modifier-key arbitration vs box-select drag). The **client-side GPU camera stays out** (Holo-wide
      non-goal): a camera Julia never hears about desyncs the Julia-projected overlay and is
      structurally one-backend-only. 3D rotation additionally depends on the Axis3 item above.
- [ ] **`PolarAxis` + `LScene` disposition (a decision item, not yet a feature commitment)** —
      the `:cairo` guard rejects both alongside `Axis3`, and `:webgl` renders them live but builds
      no overlay transforms for them (interactables keyed to them fail loud). The parity doctrine
      allows no third state: each must become a scheduled parity item (overlays on both —
      `PolarAxis`'s discrete hit geometry looks tractable now that the shared projection closure
      applies `transform_func`, where the polar map lives, though its *continuous* axis readout
      would still need the polar transform serialized to JS; `LScene` needs its own camera/scoping
      look) or an explicit Holo-wide non-goal. Until decided, this is the known interim
      per-backend gap.

## M4 — Interaction depth (new capabilities, not new surfaces)
*Goal: the Tier-0/Tier-1 interactions the architecture already supports.*

- [x] **Drag (Tier 0)**: draggable overlay geometry with live data readout via the shipped `AxisTransform`; commit on mouse-up. 60 fps, no per-frame Julia. *Done (first cut): `ThresholdInteractable` — a draggable horizontal/vertical line. The line lives entirely in the overlay (base PNG never redraws); mouse-up inverts the dragged pixel to a data scalar via `invertAxis` and round-trips it through `@bind`. `ROIInteractable` adds a draggable + resizable box (data-space bounds → `@bind`); movable points reuse the same mechanism (deferred).*
- [ ] **Animation / scrubbing (Tier 1)**: precomputed frame sequence in the manifest + a JS scrubber; bond value = current frame/param. *Payload* (not latency) is the gate: total = frames × per-frame PNG = 5.5–22 MB typical, 144–481 MB at stress scale (`perf-findings.md`) — naive full-res scrub is not viable; must shrink per-frame cost (downscale / fewer frames).
- [x] **Multi-select / box-select**: `Vector{InteractionEvent}` bond via `AbstractSelector` /
  `selects`-ROI (Design D — clicks stay single; `selects`-ROI returns the vector: points target
  → N events, grid target → 1-element region descriptor for server-side stats, empty box →
  `InteractionEvent[]`). Shipped with `gallery/gallery.jl` recipes (box-select scatter;
  image ROI per-channel stats).
- [ ] **Wide mode**: `holo(fig, …; max_width=W)` vendoring the `PlutoUI.WideCell` technique inside the widget (it no-ops under `@bind` if used externally).
- [ ] **`:webgl` tier-2 animation ergonomics**: in-place buffer patching (`find_plots(uuid)`, no new
      scene re-ship per frame) already works as a manual technique on the `:webgl` backend; still
      open is wrapping it in a proper API — a Julia accessor for a plot's uuid + a tidy
      `updatePlotData(uuid, attr, frame)` JS helper. Sibling of the `:cairo` Animation/scrubbing item
      above (that one is payload-gated; this one is a pure ergonomics wrapper around a working
      mechanism). Folded in from the former `HoloWGL/docs/roadmap.md`'s M1 on the Phase 2
      backend-selection fold-in.

## M5 — Scale & polish
- [ ] **Spatial acceleration** (quadtree/grid) for large-N hit-testing — only when the documented O(n) ceiling is actually hit (`log()` the cap until then). *Phase 0 reframe:* hit-test is ~0 ms; the wall is manifest **payload size** (~290 ms serialize+transfer at 4.78 MB), so wire-encoding (int-pixel coords / capping `values[]`) outranks a quadtree (see Phase 4).
- [x] **Perf benchmarking**: the unmeasured Q5 envelope — base64 size + click latency knee; confirm MsgPack fast-path engages. *Done (`bench/payload_envelope.jl` → `docs/perf-findings.md`): single plots 50–400 KB, manifest O(N) elements, heatmaps O(cells), animation = frames × PNG (the hard ceiling, 5.5–22 MB). MsgPack confirmed (generic maps, not the TypedArray fast-path). Full click round-trip measured live (headless Pluto + Chromium): ~65 ms median — render-bound, browser overhead negligible. Editor-lag knee (editor stutter, distinct from latency) deferred.*
- [ ] **Theming**: respect Pluto light/dark for highlight/tooltip styling (shadow-DOM scoped). *(Tooltip styling already landed in M2.3 — shadow-DOM `--holo-tip-*` + `prefers-color-scheme` dark mode; what remains is following Pluto's explicit light/dark toggle and the marker-highlight styling.)*
- [ ] **GLMakie-static backend**: GPU offscreen → PNG, same `AbstractBackend` contract (for envs with a GPU).
- [ ] **Register in General** once the API stabilizes (CHANGELOG → 0.1.0 tag → Registrator/TagBot).
- [x] **Distribution decision**: folded into `ext/HoloWGLMakieExt.jl` — see
      `.superpowers/specs/2026-06-30-holo-backend-selection-design.md`. (This also obsoletes the
      former `HoloWGL`'s own "General-registry readiness" item — there's no longer a second package
      needing its own `[compat]` bound or registration path; the item above is Holo's one registration
      story for both backends.)

---

## Non-goals (by design)
**Holo-wide** (every backend — the parity doctrine forbids capability one backend can never have):
the **client-side GPU camera** (a JS camera driven without a Julia round-trip — it desyncs the
Julia-projected overlay and is structurally `:webgl`-only) and **GPU-pick occlusion** (same
reason; the symmetric alternative, a build-time CPU cull, stays available). **High-frequency
live redraw** — per-frame kernel round-trips as a smooth-drag guarantee — is a shared *cost*
limit on both backends, not a capability split.

Per-backend there are no *feature* non-goals, only substrate facts: `:cairo` ships a static base
(its former "3D needs a browser-side renderer" note was wrong — CairoMakie renders static 3D
natively; the `Axis3` guard **lifted 2026-07-02** with the M3 Axis3 core item, so `Axis3`
overlays now ship on both backends; the guard still rejects `PolarAxis`/`LScene`, whose
disposition — parity item or Holo-wide non-goal — is an explicit M3 decision item and the one
known interim gap), and
`:webgl` ships a live canvas (so it renders 3D live today and re-renders cheaply). Backends
differ in **cost**, never in the interaction contract — enforced by the parity golden harness
(`test/fixtures/parity/`).

## Suggested order

Done: M1 · M2.1/M2.2 · M2.3 tooltips · M3 cheap-wins · M4 drag · M4 box-select · Phase 0 measure. What remains, sequenced for a polished
(not-MVP) first release. The order is driven by four real dependency edges, not by milestone
number — everything else is reorderable by demand.

**The four edges that constrain order:**
- **Perf envelope → everything payload-heavy.** Tooltips, animation frames, SVG, and the
  multi-select return shape all inflate the base64/manifest payload, whose ceiling is an
  *undocumented empirical unknown* (`research-findings.md` Q5, `design.md` §10). Measure it
  first so the rest is built against a known knee.
- **Richer tooltips → all surface payloads.** ✅ *Landed (M2.3, PR #10).* Every surface added after
  ships a real tooltip (a `holo"…"` template or the auto-table default) instead of payload JSON. The
  per-element `tooltip()` seam was replaced by a per-layer `tooltip_spec`; M3's deferred payloads
  (`{i,j,value}`, `value`, `equation`) now surface through it.
- **Multi-select → the bond contract.** `Vector{InteractionEvent}` is the forward-compatible
  extension v1 was shaped for (`architecture.md`:261). Land the contract change before stacking
  more surfaces on it. Preserve the "never `Nothing`" invariant (empty vector, not nothing).
- **Everything → registration.** Last, after the API stops moving.

### Phase 0 — Measure (front-loaded spike) ✅ *done*
- **Perf benchmarking** — *Done. See `docs/perf-findings.md` (`bench/payload_envelope.jl` to
  re-run).* The envelope: single interactive plots land 50–400 KB (at/just above Q5's plausible
  band, not below the <10 KB anecdote); manifest is O(N) elements (int-pixel geometry; per-element bytes
  in `perf-findings.md`) and O(cells) for heatmaps; **animation = frames × per-frame PNG is the hard ceiling (5.5–22 MB) — gate it.** Tooltip
  budget: <~200 B/element at N≈1 000. MsgPack confirmed (generic maps; geometry doesn't hit the
  TypedArray fast-path because the root is `Dict{String,Any}`). Full click round-trip measured
  live (headless Pluto + Chromium): **~65 ms median** (render-bound; browser/websocket overhead is
  ~tens of ms). Only the editor-lag *knee* (editor stutter at MB-scale output, distinct from
  latency) is deferred — a cheap follow-up if animation ships. **Stress-tested to the extremes:**
  round-trip is render-bound below ~1 MB but flips to *payload-bound* above a few MB (measured at a 1000²
  heatmap's 4.78 MB manifest → 553 ms, mostly serialize+transfer; that heatmap is now `values[]`-capped to
  KB, so high-N *scatter* — 200k → 7.72 MB — is the payload wall). The manifest is the high-N wall, not the
  PNG — it degrades gracefully, nothing breaks.

### Phase 1 — Foundations that unblock the rest
- [x] **M2.3 Richer tooltips** — *Done (PR #10; `docs/tooltips.md`).* Shipped as a **per-layer
  `holo"…"` template** interpolated browser-side from the already-shipped `payloads[]` — not the
  per-element-HTML approach first sketched here — so rich tooltips add **zero** new per-element wire
  bytes and the old per-element `tooltips[]` term was dropped (the budget concern is sidestepped, not
  just bounded). Plus an auto name/value table default, `tooltip_*` theming → `--holo-tip-*`,
  escape-by-default data, d3-format numbers, and two-phase validation. (d3-format is the first JS
  runtime dep; bundle delta in `perf-findings.md`.)
- [x] **Bound the grid `values[]` payload (robustness fix).** *Done (`src/interactables.jl`:
  `GRID_VALUES_MIN_SCREEN_PX`, gated on `InteractionContext.display_scale`; overlay tolerates an
  absent `values[]`). Day-one bug in shipped `holo(fig)`, shipped independently of M2.3.* The `:grid` manifest shipped the full
  source-resolution `values[]` matrix (by design today, tens of MB for a 2000²–4000²
  `heatmap!`/`image!`) purely for the `(i,j)=value` hover. **De-speculated** (`bench/encoding_experiment.jl`):
  dropping it is far smaller (see `perf-findings.md` for the measured ratio) and hit-testing needs only
  edges+dims. **Cap criterion =
  the cell's *expected on-screen* size, computed on the fly.** A Pluto cell is only so wide — display is
  bounded by the column (`max_width`, 700 px default), so we know it at build: `cell_screen_px =
  (viewport_image_px/ncols) × (display_css/image_width)`, `display_css = min(scene, max_width)`. (Today's DPI
  renders at 2× display, so the ratio is 0.5 ≈ ÷2 — compute it, don't hardcode.) Ship `values[]` only when
  `min(cell_screen_px) ≥ τ` (τ≈1–2 px); sub-pixel-on-screen cells can't be cursor-targeted → drop, payload
  `{i,j}`, one-time `@warn`. For a 600-wide figure: 50²≈12 px (keep), 200²≈3 px (keep), **1000²≈0.6 px (drop)**,
  2000²–4000² (drop). It's an *expected* size (overlay still hit-tests against the true runtime scale).
  Self-tuning and **subsumes the special `Image` case** (source-res > display-res → sub-pixel → auto-drop).
  See `architecture.md` §8.
- [x] **M4 Multi-select / box-select** — *Done.* `AbstractSelector <: AbstractInteractable`
  interface (`selects(sel)`, `compatible_kinds(sel)`) + `ROIInteractable(…; selects=:id)` as the
  first concrete selector. Design-D bond contract: clicks / bounds-only ROI stay single
  `InteractionEvent`; a `selects`-ROI returns `Vector{InteractionEvent}` — points target → N
  events, grid target → 1-element region descriptor `(; i0,i1,j0,j1,xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax)` for
  server-side stats (browser never needs `values[]` for selection), empty box →
  `InteractionEvent[]` (never `nothing`). Wire: only new manifest field is `selects` string on
  the ROI layer; `transform_value` keys on the `{ items: [...] }` JS envelope shape.
  `targetKind`/`arity` were dropped as redundant. Shipped with `gallery/gallery.jl` recipes
  (box-select scatter; image ROI per-channel stats).

### Phase 2 — Surface coverage (parallel; each now carries a real payload)
No new JS primitive in this phase — every surface reuses v1's `:rects`/`:polygons` tests; the
work is always a Julia-side extractor. (`update_state_before_display!(fig)` is the mandatory
pre-manifest step for all three.)
- [x] **Bars/areas** *(done except Legend — Colorbar done M3; see M3)*: Hist/Waterfall/CrossBar/HSpan/VSpan auto-extracted as `:rects`; shared bar payload schema (semantic, no `index`); span viewport-clamp; uniform payload-length validation. Colorbar: done (M3) — `ColorbarInteractable` via figure-block walk. *Remaining: Legend (deferred).*
- [x] **Filled-area curves (Band/Density)**: Band and Density auto-extracted as `:polygons` with `(; index)` payload.
- [x] **Computational-geometry extraction** (Contourf/Tricontourf, Violin, Voronoiplot, BoxPlot
  notches → polygons): Contourf/Violin/Voronoiplot + BoxPlot box-body shipped; Tricontourf
  deferred; BoxPlot box-body-only — whiskers/outliers decorative. All reuse v1's `:polygons`
  even-odd test; no new JS primitive. Principle: hit geometry from rendered shapes; payload from
  Makie's computed values.
- [x] **Text bboxes** (Text, Annotation) — *not* a 7th primitive, but not for the reason originally
  guessed either: the plan was that rotated text needs a degenerate-polygon `bbox` primitive plus
  **font-metric measurement** (the one thing the coord system was built not to model, `design.md`
  §6). Both turned out obsolete — `Makie.string_boundingboxes(p)` already returns each string's
  scene-local pixel box (font metrics included), so `TextInteractable` rides plain `:rects`
  instead: a rotated label just gets its box expanded to stay axis-aligned. Payload
  `(; text, index, x, y)`; `holo(fig)` auto-detects `text!` directly and `annotation!` via
  `_descendant(p, Makie.Text)`; only data-space text is auto-detected (pixel/relative-space text
  is skipped with a warning). **`TextLabel` is deferred**: it's a `Makie.Block`, not a plot, so it
  needs the figure-block walk (`fig.content`, the mechanism `ColorbarInteractable` uses), not the
  scene-plot walk this arc used — a small follow-up, not a design unknown.

These three are independent and can run concurrently.

### Phase 3 — Interaction depth
- **Animation / scrubbing (Tier 1)** — precomputed frames baked into one manifest (the snapshot
  model *forces* this, not live Observables). Rehydrate scrubber position from
  `data-*`/sessionStorage/`@bind`, never element instance state. Payload-heavy → must fit the
  Phase-0 envelope; a JS scrubber may trip the framework-revisit trigger.
- **Wide mode** (`max_width=W`) — *not* cheap: vendor the WideCell technique inside the widget
  (PlutoUI's no-ops under `@bind`), and a `max_width` change forces a full re-render (new Screen
  + regenerated manifest), not a CSS resize. Self-contained; slot anytime in this phase.

### Phase 4 — Output & scale (gated by Phase 0)
- **SVG output path** — base SVG output is already the `mount=:svg` seam; the new part is the
  overlay over a vector base. Least-validated item: gate behind a viability spike (primitive-count
  threshold; SVG uses `pt_per_unit/0.75`, not `px_per_unit`). Sparse-plot mode only — dense plots
  stay PNG. Pairs naturally with Phase 0.
- **Spatial acceleration** (quadtree/grid) — demand-gated; may never be built. Grids are already
  O(1), so scope is only flat list layers (Scatter/rect-`:list`/segments). JS-only; must preserve
  manifest-order first-match. **Phase 0 measured hit-test at ~0 ms** (scatter-50/10k) and found the
  first wall is manifest *payload size* (serialize+transfer), not hit-test CPU — so build this *only*
  if a profile ever shows JS hit-test **specifically** (not serialize/transfer) is the bottleneck.
  (Phase 0 did not stress hit-test at extreme N≈200k; but there the 7.72 MB manifest dominates anyway.)
- [x] **Int-pixel geometry quantization (perf win).** *Done (`src/interactables.jl`: per-element geometry
  vectors built as `Int` via `_q(x) = round(Int, x)` — circles/segments/rects/polygons/regions + grid edges).*
  **De-speculated** (`bench/encoding_experiment.jl`): real MsgPack gives **−58%** on the geometry term
  (5.00 → 2.10 B/coord); it needs **no manifest-shape change** (msgpack already encodes small ints in 1–3 B;
  the frontend reads numbers either way), and ≤0.5px rounding is inside the ~1px hit-test tolerance. On a
  whole realistic manifest the saving is ~17 % (geometry is one term beside the payload's Float64 `x`/`y`);
  at high-N scatter it pushed the 200k wall 9.28 → 7.72 MB (`perf-findings.md`). **Constraint (held):**
  quantize per-element geometry only — `AxisTransform` lims/viewport stay `Float64` (the M4 drag inverts
  pixel→data through them). See `architecture.md` §9.
  - *Rejected by the same experiment:* lifting geometry to a top-level typed `Vector` to engage MsgPack's
    TypedArray binary fast-path — measured only ~5% beyond int-quantization (2.00 vs 2.10 B/coord), not
    worth the manifest-shape rewrite. `Float16` is a non-starter (no msgpack float16; lossy >2048px).

### Phase 5 — Polish & release
- **Theming** (Pluto light/dark, shadow-DOM scoped) — overlay can theme freely (shadow root +
  bundled CSS already in place); the opaque base PNG can't follow the theme without a re-render —
  scope accordingly.
- **GLMakie-static backend** — first do the prerequisite seam refactor (move
  `data_to_image_px`/projection onto the rendercontext so it isn't hard-bound to CairoMakie),
  then the backend slots in behind the same contract. Must stay static→PNG (no 3D/live). Optional.
- **Register in General** — strictly last, after the API stabilizes. Needs the committed in-tree
  bundle + CI-on-GitHub; CHANGELOG → 0.1.0 tag on a CI-built commit → Registrator/TagBot.
